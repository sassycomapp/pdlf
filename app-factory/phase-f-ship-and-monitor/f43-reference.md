## Client instance check

## Task Execution Order

1. Run GStack [[[pdlf:app-factory/phase-e-build-and-verify/e38-reference|/qa]]](C:/pdlf/app-factory/phase-e-build-and-verify/e38-reference.md) or `/canary` — at the test client instance, running the release image from Step 42
2. Follow execution sequence in [[[pdlf:pdlf-library/specifications-local/spec-execution-discipline]]](C:/pdlf/pdlf-library/specifications-local/spec-execution-discipline.md)
3. Apply BFT per [[[pdlf:pdlf-library/specifications-local/spec-bft]]](C:/pdlf/pdlf-library/specifications-local/spec-bft.md) at assigned level (Full)

## Description

QA or canary check at the test client instance. Confirms the release image works
on live infrastructure before App 5's Release action moves any client.

## Inputs Required

- The test client instance's address
- Test plan or canary configuration

## Outputs

- Smoke test report — pass/fail on the test client instance
- The test client instance's health baseline

## Step Table

## Reference

OpenCode is always the orchestrator. Invoke skills only when they beat OpenCode directly.

For execution sequence: [[[pdlf:pdlf-library/specifications-local/spec-execution-discipline]]](C:/pdlf/pdlf-library/specifications-local/spec-execution-discipline.md)
For BFT procedure: [[[pdlf:pdlf-library/specifications-local/spec-bft]]](C:/pdlf/pdlf-library/specifications-local/spec-bft.md)

GBrain is queried automatically at substep 1. Syncing is asked at substep 10, never auto-run.
The two housekeeping questions are asked separately, every step, never combined, never auto-run.

The ledger row, Step Receipt, and devlog-index/judgement-trail are the complete checkpoint.
No separate state file, devlog file, or completion report.

Skills save where designed. PDLF process artifacts go to `<project-library>/pdlf/`.
